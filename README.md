ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! my name is Vladimir Appiah

Iâ€™m a Data & Analytics Analyst in the Financial Services Industry with a B.A. in Health Sciences
(yes, I went from studying cells to crunching cellsâ€”Excel cells, that is).

My goal is to make data analysis as painless as possible, so you can level up, land a job you love, and maybe even afford that extra guac.

I also love working with different technologies & platforms and my current favorite ones are

> SQL / MySQL
> Python
> Tableau
