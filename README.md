ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! my name is Vladimir Appiah

Iâ€™m a Data & Analytics Analyst in the Financial Services Industry with a B.A. in Health Sciences
(yes, I went from studying cells to crunching cellsâ€”Excel cells, that is).

My goal? To make data analysis as painless as possible, so you can level up, land a job you love, and maybe even afford that extra guac.
